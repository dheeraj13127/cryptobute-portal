## What is CryptoBute?

## The problem CryptoBute solves
CryptoBute's primary target is audience those who are in desperate need of financial assistance to pay for medical treatments that may be too expensive for them to afford.

Problems with traditional crowdfunding
With traditional crowdfunding platforms the transactions may not be 100% secure
Since vital data is involved such as medical records , it is at risk in a centralised platform

## How CryptoBute solves the problem?

The smart contract functionality ensures that the funds raised are not misused and only the amount approved by the contributors is reached to the end user
The campaigns are transparent and the authenticity of the campaign is agreed upon by the majority
The transactions are transparent hence the contributors can verify and cannot be tampered.
